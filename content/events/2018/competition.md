## Game overview

[<img src="/img/2018/arena.png" alt="A diagram of the arena" class="right" width="30%">](/img/2018/arena.png "A diagram of the arena, click to see larger")

In this year's game, _Pirate Islands_, each robot's scoring zone starts a match
containing five tokens which belonged to the team from the opposite corner.
Robots have to avoid each other, as well as four pedestals placed between the
scoring zones (see arena diagram).

Robots score two points for each of their own tokens in their scoring zone, but
lose a point for each other token in their scoring zone.

## League Scores

League matches make up most of the competition and seed the knockout. Winning a
match earns 8 league points, coming second earns 6 points, third 4 points and
last 2 points. Teams not present for a match do not earn any league points. Ties
are resolved by sharing the league points for the tied positions evenly.

The results from this year's competition are below:

other prizes are available [on our blog][prize-details].
