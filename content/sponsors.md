SourceBots relies on the tireless effort of its volunteers and generous support
from its sponsors in order to operate.

## General Sponsors

These sponsors support all our activities, both running our
[larger competition][larger-competition] and the Smallpeice
[Summer School][summer-school].

### [University of Southampton][uos-website]

We are sponsored by the University of Southampton Electronics and Computer
Science Department so that we can be a source of recruitment for potential
<abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics">STEM</abbr>
students, currently in their A-level/sixth-form years and looking at
universities for Electronics, Computer Science, or Engineering courses.

### [Farnell element14][farnell-website]

{{< figure class="supporter-logo" src="/img/sponsors/element14.svg" alt="element14 Logo" width="200" >}}

Farnell supports us by providing components for the kits.

We write blog posts for their website for other societies or organisations
trying to do similar things (i.e. running robotics competitions, building
competition-running software, running a STEM outreach programme with
volunteers).

## Smallpeice Summer School

These sponsors support us in running the week-long Smallpeice [Summer School][summer-school].

### [Smallpeice Trust][smallpeice-website]

{{< figure class="supporter-logo" src="/img/sponsors/smallpeice.svg" alt="Smallpeice Logo" width="200" >}}

The Smallpeice Trust is an independent charity which works with universities and
other institutions to provide <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics">STEM</abbr> programmes to children in schools (typically ages
12-18) and allow them to get involved with and excited about a career in STEM
subjects.

They support our Summer School by getting the kids involved in the first place
and paying for some aspects of the competition proceedings (e.g. kits,
volunteers if there is budget for it).

### [ARM][arm-website]

{{< figure class="supporter-logo" src="/img/sponsors/arm.svg" alt="ARM Logo" width="200" >}}

ARM is an international company which develops the architecture used by billions
of processing chips across all kinds of technology.

They sponsor a number of Smallpeice programmes including the Summer School.
