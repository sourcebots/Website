The Smallpeice Trust is an independent charity which works with universities and
other institutions to provide <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics">STEM</abbr> programmes to children in schools (typically ages
12-18) and allow them to get involved with and excited about a career in STEM
subjects.

They provide the organisational support for the young people who attend the
Summer School so that SourceBots can focus on providing the technical content
and competition aspects.
