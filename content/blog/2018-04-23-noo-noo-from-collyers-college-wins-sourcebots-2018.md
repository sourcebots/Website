SourceBots 2018 reached its exciting climax this weekend as the teams from
across the south coast gathered at the University of Southampton for the
competition event. The two-day event saw their fully autonomous robots compete
in forty matches to determine which would be crowned champion in this year's
game _Pirate Islands_.

### Competition

The game required the robots to remove other robot's tokens from their scoring
zone and collect their own tokens from the opposing side of the 8×8m arena. As
any of the four robots in the arena could move any token, this required the
robots to detect which tokens were where and to react to changes. Full details
can be found in the [rules](/documents/2018/rules.pdf).

The matches were broken into two main sections. First was a league stage with
matches spaced throughout the weekend and interspersed with "tinker time" which
both allowed the teams to test and improve their robots as well as gauge the
strengths of their opponents. The time between rounds proved invaluable to many
of the teams and we saw the robots improve greatly over the course of the
weekend.

Once the league was complete, the results from the league seeded a knockout
stage. While every robot entered the knockouts, it all came down to the final
match between _[Noo Noo][CLY-robot-image]_ from [Collyer's][collyers] team
_SCC_, _[Out Of The Blue][RGS-robot-image]_ from [RGS Guildford][rgs-guildford],
_[Brenda][BPV2-robot-image]_ from [Barton Peveril][barton-peveril]'s second team
and [the robot][BRK-robot-image] from team _Bodgenhurst_ from
[Brockenhurst][brockenhurst].

The final promised to be interesting as a variety of different approaches were
taken by the participating robots. _Out Of The Blue_, _Brenda_ and
_Bodgenhurst_'s robot each attempted to capture tokens in their open front
halves by driving up to tokens with their arms open, before closing them around
the tokens.

_Out Of The Blue_ extended this strategy by first driving through the tokens in
their own zone with their arms closed, which pushed some of the undesirable
tokens out of their zone before they collected their own tokens. This had given
the robot a strong position after the league matches; by ranking second they
went straight through to the semi-finals.

In the end however it was _Noo Noo_'s great use of its [Mecanum
wheels][mecanum-wheels] and long grabber arm to drive _sideways_ through their
own zone at the start of the match, sweeping the undesirable tokens out of the
zone, which granted their victory.
